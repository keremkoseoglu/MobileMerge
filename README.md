# MobileMerge

This abandoned (but once useful) C# project was written to send bulk SMS messages from the Windows desktop.

Mail merge of Microsoft Word is able to send personalized mail or E-Mail messages.

Following the same logic, MobileMerge enabled me to:
- Create a message template
- Read & select Outlook contacts
- Generate personalized messages for selected contacts
- Edit each message as necessary
- Write the messages to a folder which was readable by my (discontinued) Siemens mobile phone

Afterwards, my Siemens mobile phone was able to import & send those SMS messages.

This application has proven to be quite useful. I was able to generate & send my own messages without paying anything to third party bulk SMS vendors.
